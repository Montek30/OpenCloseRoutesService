This is a script that checks if the routes are open/closed at a given interval of time.
The script code is in the backend_script.py file.

This script has been implemented using python3.6. Though there are several ways of implementing the service, I have kept it quite simple. No need to install any librarires. This project has no dependencies on the environment too.

Steps to Run the Script.

1. Import/Clone/Unzip the project into your local directory.
2. Move to the directory.
3. Run Command: python3.6 backend_script.py OR python backend_script.py 
4. The script should run.

How to give Input to the Script?
You need to the input in each line of the terminal. Press Enter for multiple inputs. Once you have given all the inputs, in the new line Press Key "X".

The outputs will be displayed in the following lines.

Also, I am attaching the screenshot of the terminal window which will give an idea on how to run the script.

Thank You.
